 # Kickstarter Campaigns: The Impact of Goals and Launch Dates on Outcomes
## Overview
Louise wants to understand how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. To get some answers for her we have analyized a large data set of kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017. We looked at three outcomes; successful, failed and canceled campaigns and asked the questions:

-How does the month in which a campaign is launched impact its outcome?

-How does the amount of a funding goal impact the outcome?

Utlimately the purpose of this analyisis is to understand how the variables launch date and funding goal can effect the outcome of a kickstarter campaign. We want to determine what month Louise should start her kickstarter and what she should set as her funding goal in order to avoid a canceled and failed outcomes and achieve a succeessful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch DateM 
### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of the outcomes based on Launch date tells us that the most successful time of year to start a Theater Kickstarter campaign is in the month of May. This  can be visualized above in the chart.  We can see starting in March the number of successful campaigns was 56 but steadily increased exclerating in April and reaching its maximum of 111 successful campaigns in the Month of May. Looking at successful campaigns over the course of the year the best time for Louise to Launch her campaign would be May. 

Alteratively the greatest number of failed campaigns occurred in October.  Again this can be seen in the chart above. We see a significant spike with 50 failed kickstarters the most over the course of the year and only 65 successful campaigns, far from the 111 in May.  This would be the worst time of the year to launch a kickstarter.
