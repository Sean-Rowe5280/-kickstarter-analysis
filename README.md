 # Kickstarter Theater Campaigns: The Impact of Goals and Launch Dates on Outcomes
## Overview
Louise wants to understand how different kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. To get some answers for her we have analyized a large data set of kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017. We looked at three outcomes; successful, failed and canceled campaigns and asked the questions:

-How does the month in which a campaign is launched impact its outcome?

-How does the amount of a funding goal impact the outcome?

Utlimately the purpose of this analyisis is to understand how the variables launch date and funding goal can effect the outcome of a kickstarter campaign. We want to determine what month Louise should start her kickstarter and what she should set as her funding goal in order to avoid a canceled and failed outcomes and achieve a succeessful campaign.
